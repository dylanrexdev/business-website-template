# basic-website-template

This is a basic HTML5, static website template that will be mobile responsive, and have a "fill-in-the-blank" HTML skeleton for content.
All of this is built by me, @dylanrex. Feel free to use it for anything you have a need for it. First uploaded on 3/1/2025

## Current To-DO List
- [ ] Complete initial skeleton for index, home, and contact html files
- [ ] Finalize mobile responsiveness with the nav menu collapsing into a hamburger menu
- [ ] Create a secondary theme that can be easily installed by redirecting the stylesheet
